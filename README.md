# dart-freezed-snippets README

Handy snippets for working with the `freezed` library.

By far the most useful are `fdataclass` and `funioncase`.

If you're reading this, and you're not me, and you'd like a better readme: send me a message. I only created this repository to make migrating my vscode snippets to vim easier.
